# Stakeholder Impact Overview: Adapting to the Digital System

**Purpose:** This document outlines how the transition to the **Intelligent Transport Management System (TMS)** will affect different roles within our organization. Its goal is to provide clarity, alleviate concerns, and highlight the personal benefits for every team member.

## 1. Senior Leadership & Management

**The Change:** Moving from "Management by Anecdote" to "Management by Data."
You will no longer rely on delayed reports or second-hand information to understand the health of the business.

*   **How your role changes:**
    *   **Old Way:** Waiting for end-of-month reconciliations to see if the company made a profit.
    *   **New Way:** Check the "Super Dashboard" on your phone to see live revenue, fleet status, and daily totals at any moment.
*   **Your Benefits:**
    *   **Peace of Mind:** Reduced risk of internal fraud and revenue leakage.
    *   **Growth Focus:** Less time fighting fires, more time dealing with strategy and expansion.
*   **Key Responsibility:**
    *   Enforcing the policy that "The System is the Source of Truth."

## 2. Operations Supervisors

**The Change:** Moving from "Chaos Coordinator" to "Fleet Controller."
You are currently the busiest people, dealing with phone calls, manual schedules, and crises. The system is designed to act as your assistant.

*   **How your role changes:**
    *   **Old Way:** Calling 10 drivers to find out where they are or who can take a shift.
    *   **New Way:** Drag-and-drop buses onto schedules on a screen. See driver availability instantly. Swap a broken-down bus with one click.
*   **Your Benefits:**
    *   **Less Stress:** The system handles the complex logic (e.g., preventing double-booking).
    *   **Visibility:** You can see exactly where every bus is on the live map without making a phone call.
*   **Key Responsibility:**
    *   Ensuring schedules are published on time so sales can begin.

## 3. Station Agents (Ticket Sellers)

**The Change:** Moving from "Cashier & Calculator" to "Customer Service Pro."
Your job is to sell, not to do math. The system removes the burden of manual bookkeeping.

*   **How your role changes:**
    *   **Old Way:** Writing tickets by hand, manually calculating totals, stressing about balancing the cash book at the end of the day.
    *   **New Way:** Tap the destination on a tablet, accept payment, and the system prints/sends the ticket. The system does the math for you.
*   **Your Benefits:**
    *   **Speed:** Sell tickets 3x faster, meaning shorter queues and happier customers.
    *   **Accuracy:** No more penalties for calculation errors. If the system says you sold $500, you have exactly $500.
*   **Key Responsibility:**
    *   Accurately entering passenger phone numbers (critical for customer notifications).

## 4. Drivers & Conductors

**The Change:** Moving from "Gatekeeper" to "Pilot."
You are responsible for the safe transport of passengers, not for untangling ticket disputes.

*   **How your role changes:**
    *   **Old Way:** Arguing with passengers about whether their paper ticket is valid, valid for *today*, or if they already used it.
    *   **New Way:** You scan the passenger's QR code. The App says "GREEN" (Go) or "RED" (Stop). There is no argument; the system decides.
*   **Your Benefits:**
    *   **Protection:** You cannot be accused of stealing cash fares if you follow the "Scan Every Passenger" rule. The digital record protects your reputation.
    *   **Clarity:** Your App tells you exactly where you are going, what time to leave, and how many people should be on board.
*   **Key Responsibility:**
    *   **"No Scan, No Ride."** Use the App to validate every single person boarding the vehicle.

## 5. Inspectors & Auditors

**The Change:** Moving from "Random Checks" to "Generic Validation."
Your job becomes faster and more effective because you have better tools.

*   **How your role changes:**
    *   **Old Way:** Walking through a bus looking at pieces of paper, hoping to spot a fake signature or date.
    *   **New Way:** Scan a passenger's ticket with your inspection device. It instantly checks the central server to see if that ticket was validly sold and paid for.
*   **Your Benefits:**
    *   **Authority:** The device provides undeniable proof if a passenger is traveling without a valid ticket.
    *   **Efficiency:** You can check a whole bus in half the time.
*   **Key Responsibility:**
    *   Spot-checking buses to ensure the "Digital Manifest" matches the physical heads on board.
